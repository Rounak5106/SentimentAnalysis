# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project, developed during my internship at *Addauto Technology Pvt. Ltd., implements a general-purpose **Sentiment Analysis* tool using AI/ML and NLP to classify text as positive or negative. It is demonstrated using the *Sentiment140* Twitter dataset as a case study, but can be applied to any text data (e.g., reviews, comments).

## Objectives
- Build a flexible sentiment analysis model for text classification.
- Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Compare Naive Bayes and BERT models for performance.
- Visualize sentiment distribution and model results for clear insights.
